One way to select direct siblings in CSS is by using the ~ general sibling selector. This selector matches any sibling element that comes after the first element, regardless of their positions.

Here's an example of how you can use the general sibling selector to target direct siblings: -->

<style>
    p ~ p {
        color: blue;
    }
</style>

<div>
    <p>I'm a paragraph</p>
    <p>I'm a direct sibling of the previous paragraph and will be selected</p>
    <h2>Monkey hair</h2>
    <p>I'm not a direct sibling and will not be selected</p>
</div>

<!-- 
In the example above, the CSS selector p ~ p selects any <p> element that is a direct sibling of another <p> element.

Keep in mind that the general sibling selector selects all siblings that come after the first element, not just the immediate sibling.

If you specifically need to select only the immediate sibling, you may need to use JavaScript or a CSS preprocessor like Sass, which provides additional functionality for selecting direct siblings.
