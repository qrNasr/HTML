<!-- In this example, we have a <div> element with the class "container" that acts as a container for the user profile photo. The container has a relative position to act as a reference for the absolutely positioned child element.

Inside the container, there's another <div> element with the class "profile-photo" that represents the user profile photo. This element has an absolute position and is centered vertically and horizontally using the top: 50%, left: 50%, and transform: translate(-50%, -50%) properties.

The profile photo element has a fixed width and height, a border-radius of 50% to create a circular shape, and a background image specified using the background-image property. Adjust the URL of the image to the desired profile photo.

The background-size: cover property ensures that the image covers the entire element, and background-position: center centers the image within the element. -->
