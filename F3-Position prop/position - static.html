<!-- In this example, we have a <div> element with the class "container" that acts as a container for other elements. The container has a fixed width and height and a background color. Inside the container, there's another <div> element with the class "box" that represents a box inside the container.

The "box" element has a fixed width and height and a background color. By default, elements have a position: static value, which means they are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. In other words, they are positioned in the order they appear in the HTML code and their position cannot be changed using the top, bottom, left, or right properties.

With position: static, the box is positioned statically, which means it is not affected by any positioning properties and is placed in the normal flow of the document. -->
